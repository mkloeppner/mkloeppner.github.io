Being part of the mobile industry and the growth of apple's platforms OS X and iOS was a pleasure in the last years.

Not just that the success of mobile devices let all analyst's still struggle in their self-confidence,
its more about the amount of power and enthusiasm that a lot of OS X or iOS developers spend on providing first class software, tools and frameworks.

Now what I am doing here?

Since I am a young and passionated developer I also want to share my experience.

So welcome to my personal Swift, Objective-C, C and software development blog.

Lets bootstrap:

{% highlight objective-c %}
var jedi = NSJedi(rang: NSJedi.Padawan)
jedi.practiceForce() // In order to increase possibilities
jedi.practiceFighting() // In order to increase the efficiency
jedi.followPath() // In order to ensure sustainability
{% endhighlight %}
