## Tupel

A tupel is a comma separated lists of values within curly braces:

```swift
(3,5,6,8,10)
```

A tuple can contain the same value multiple times:

```swift
(10,10,6,8,10)
```

A tuple can be assigned to a variable or constant:

```swift
let x = (10,10,6,8,10)
```

A constant or variable containing a tuple can be decomposed:
```swift
let x = (10,10,6,8,10)

let (a,b,c,d,e,f) = x;
```

Decomposing do not require to assign every value a constant or variable.
A position within a tuple can be skipped by '_'
```swift
let x = (10,10,6,8,10)

let (_,b,_,d,_,_) = x;
```

A tuple can be have identifier for its values:
```swift
let x = (age: 10, level: 10, 6, 8, 10)
println(x.age)
```

Identifiers can be used for decomposing a tuple:
```swift
let x = (age: 10, level: 10, 6, 8, 10)
```

Tuple signatures contain types instead of values:
```swift
(String, String, Int, UInt, UInt)
```

Also Tuple signatures can have a identifier for every associated type:
```swift
(name: String, lastName: String, age: UInt)
```
